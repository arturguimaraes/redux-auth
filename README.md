# Redux Auth

<p>Redux Auth uses the concepts of Redux for the counter and authentication.</p>
<p>Basically is playing around with Redux, Slices, useDispatch, useSelect and configuring the store for that information.</p>
<p>To test it, clone the repository, open the folder in Visual Studio Code, then open the terminal and run 'npm install' then 'npm start' commands.</p>
